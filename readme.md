# Elementor Responsive Image Widget
## Overview
Elementor Responsive Image is a responsive image widget for [Elementor](https://elementor.com).

## Why?
There is no responsive image control within Elementor. Elementor does allow for responsive background images, but has no native responsive `img` element.

Not sure when to use `img` or css background image? 

*Is the image part of the **content**, or part of the **design**?*

It is better to use `img` elements when:
1. They have semantic meaning within the content i.e. picture of a person etc.
2. They should be indexed by search engines.
3. The `alt`, `title` and `figcaption` are needed.
4. They should be printed by default.

It is better to use background-images when:
1. Image is purely for design.
2. Image should not be printed by default.

## Features
1. Ability to select mobile, tablet, and desktop images.
2. Ability to select the element to use: `img` or `picture`.
3. Ability to select the [orientation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/orientation) when using the picture element.
4. Ability to set the default loading behavior for the image: eager or lazy.
5. Ability to use Elementor Pro dynamic tags.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Zip the contents into an archive/zip file.
